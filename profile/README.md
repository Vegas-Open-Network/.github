# Vegas Open Network (VONet)

VONet is a nonprofit project building a **fair, accessible, and community-owned internet** across Las Vegas.  
Inspired by [NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net) and guided by the [Network Commons License]([https://networkcommons.org/ncl/](https://wiki.vonet.org/index.php?title=Network_Commons_License)),
we run an open network that anyone can join.

We develop the code, tools, and docs that keep the network running and growing.
